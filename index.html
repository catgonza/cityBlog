    <h1>Providencia Island - Colombia</h1>
    <p>
      Providencia is a laid-back Caribbean Island, super undeveloped and not
      really Colombia at all.<br />The majority of the people are descended from
      slaves the British brought there centuries ago, and<br />sometimes you
      wonder how much has changed since then. There is one road around the
      island, with<br />very few side roads. It is circled by pristine reef,
      that shines like a blue jewel when you fly over<br />it upon arrival. In
      the center, are lush green mountains you can take a short hike up. If you
      just want<br />to relax, then you have found the right place. But there is
      also plenty to do here.
