      <p>
        Providencia is a laid-back Caribbean Island, super undeveloped and not
        really Colombia at all.<br />The majority of the people are descended
        from slaves the British brought there centuries ago, and<br />sometimes
        you wonder how much has changed since then. There is one road around the
        island, with<br />very few side roads. It is circled by pristine reef,
        that shines like a blue jewel when you fly over<br />it upon arrival. In
        the center, are lush green mountains you can take a short hike up. If
        you just want<br />to relax, then you have found the right place. But
        there is also plenty to do here.
